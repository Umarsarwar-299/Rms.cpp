This C++ program manages recipes using object-oriented programming. It defines four main classes: Ingredient, Recipe, User, and MealPlan.

The Ingredient class stores the name and quantity of a single ingredient and has a method to display it.

The Recipe class holds a recipe's title, list of ingredients (as Ingredient objects), and cooking instructions. It includes methods to add ingredients and display the recipe.

The User class represents a user who can save multiple recipes and view them.

The MealPlan class is defined to associate a recipe with a day, though it's not used in the main function.

In the main() function:

A User object named "Alice" is created.

The user is asked how many recipes they want to add.

For each recipe, the program prompts for:

Title and instructions

Number of ingredients

Name and quantity of each ingredient

The recipe is built and saved to Aliceâ€™s saved recipes list.

After all recipes are entered, they are displayed back to the user.

The program demonstrates class design, dynamic input handling with vectors, and simple user interaction through console input/output.
